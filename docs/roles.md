# Roles

There are a fixed number of roles that is present. Like for example _admin_, _normal_, _manager_ etc.
Each **_admin_** (who pays for the product) can create extra roles for their specific company.

So each role will have its own _admin_id_ corresponding to the admin who created the role for custom roles and it will be empty for default roles.
When listing the roles in the index page it will be a combination of default roles and roles created by the admin user.
