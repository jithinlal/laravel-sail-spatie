# Company

When a user is created/signed up for the first time they will be registered under a **company**. This company id will be used for base operation for many things within the project.
<br>
For example, if a role needs to be created, that role will be created by an admin to a company, so later if another user with the permission to list the roles comes up,
the roles will be shown to the user by looking at their _company_id_ (and also the default roles). 
<br>
A **company** will be linked to a **user**.
